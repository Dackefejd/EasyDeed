# Data Preset Templates
This repository contains JSON templates used as starting points when creating new Data Presets in the EasyDeeds platform. These templates help streamline and standardize the process of retrieving and interpreting data from external sources.

## Usage
When creating a new Data Preset via the admin interface or code, these templates can be used as pre-filled values. They provide a consistent structure and help prevent misconfiguration when setting up data sources.
